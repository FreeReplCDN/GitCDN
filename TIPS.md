# How to get paid

All users must create a "Payment Sink" if they wish to be paid in "Cycles", which is a repl where the cycles earned will be distributed to all active team members.

### Thou shalt modify only his/her own row, and must not modify other rows without approval of 1/2 or more of the active team members.

| User           | Payment Sink                                  |

python660> also, we should designate one repl to receive payment from our users, and have that person give cycles to everyone in the team through a repl (one for each user)
python660> the owner of the designated repl should share the repl with everyone in the team.
python660> The designated owner must fill out a data table every 2 weeks (time can be changed) to calculate the difference in tip amount
